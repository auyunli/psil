# psil

psil is under development and will be a simple experimental language aiming to borrow syntactic-ness of functional-like languages such as LISP, Erlang, and others. A major goal of this experiment will be implementation and optimization of garbage collector algorithms.

Prototype is currently constructed with Flex and Bison and is executed in C++ runtime. 

## Dependencies:
Flex, Bison  

## Todo:
language specification  
language implementation  
runtime implementation
